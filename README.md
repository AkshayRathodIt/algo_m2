**Algotrading Project with Python and FYERS API**

## Introduction
This project is an algotrading system built using Python and the FYERS API. Algotrading, short for algorithmic trading, involves using computer algorithms to automate the process of trading financial instruments in the market. In this project, we will leverage the FYERS API to execute trades automatically based on predefined strategies and market conditions.
